Overview
--------

In the event-based model that is used by the Iotic labs digital twin solution an :term:`integrator`'s job is to communicate with the source(s) of data and to provide the twin with data in the form of events
The :term:`twin` stores these events as an :term:`Event Stream`.
A :term:`follower` then binds to the twin and receives events from it when new ones arrive. Followers can request the twin to replay the stream from a particular offset.

This guide is a task-based approach to writing either a integrator and/or an follower. The guide will take you through the steps necessary to write each one
