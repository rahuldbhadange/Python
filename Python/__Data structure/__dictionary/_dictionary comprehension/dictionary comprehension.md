Python Dictionary Comprehension:
Dictionary comprehension is a method for transforming one dictionary into another dictionary. 
During this transformation, items within the original dictionary can be conditionally included 
in the new dictionary and each item can be transformed as needed.

A good list comprehension can make your code more expressive and thus, easier to read. 
The key with creating comprehensions is to not let them get so complex that your head spins 
when you try to decipher what they are actually doing. Keeping the idea of "easy to read" alive.

The way to do dictionary comprehension in Python is to be able to access the key objects and 
the value objects of a dictionary.



Why Use Dictionary Comprehension?
Dictionary comprehension is a powerful concept and can be used to substitute for loops and lambda functions.
However, not all for loop can be written as a dictionary comprehension but 
all dictionary comprehension can be written with a for loop.



Alternative to for loops:
For loops are used to repeat a certain operation or a block of instructions in a program for a given number of times.
However, nested for loops (for loop inside another for loop) can get confusing and complex. 
Dictionary comprehensions are better in such situations and can simplify the readability and your understanding of the code.

Alternative to lambda functions:
Lambda functions are a way of creating small anonymous functions.
They are functions without a name.
These functions are throw-away functions, which are only needed where they have been created.
Lambda functions are mainly used in combination with the functions filter(), map() and reduce().
