# within the class we can represent data using
# i.static variables
# ii.non static  variables
#
#
#
# Static variables:The variables which are defined within the class and defined
#  outside all the methods are known as static variables.
#
#
#
#  ex: class sample:
#           x=10 #static variable,defined within class and outside the method
#           def m1():
#               print(x)
#
#  properties of static variable
#
#  1.The data which is common for all the objects,then it is recommended to
#   represent by using static variables.
#
#      ex:bank name---->SBI
#         withdrawlimit-->2500
#
#     data which is changing from one object to another object--->then
#     use non-static variable
#     ex:-ename,eid,designation,salary
#
#  2.for static variable,only once memory is allocated.
#  3.A static variable can be accessed by all the methods of that class and also
#    by other classes
#  4.A static variable can be accessed by using classname.
#
#  diff b/w function and method
#  function will be defined ouside the class
#  method will be within the class







# frro = frozenset([1,2,3,5,5,85,85])
# print(frro)
