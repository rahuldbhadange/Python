# A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.


"""
Syntax:

class C(object):
    @staticmethod
    def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):
        ...
returns: a static method for function fun.

A static method is also a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
A static method canâ€™t access or modify class state.
It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
