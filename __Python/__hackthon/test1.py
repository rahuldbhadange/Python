The first line of each test case consist of number of villains and player, N.
The second line of each test case consist of the N space separated strengths of Villains.
The third line of each test case consist of N space separated energy of players.


Constraints
1<= T <=10
1<= N <=1000
1<= strength , energy <=100000

Output Format
For each test case, Print WIN if all villains can be killed else print LOSE in separate lines.
