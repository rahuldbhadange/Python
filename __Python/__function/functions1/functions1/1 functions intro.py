Functions in python

Function: A Function is a block of statements,which is used to perform particular task

A function can be executed for many times.

To execute functions,we need to make a function call

functions can be called or executed on demand.


we define a function using keyword def


syntax for defining a function :
    
def functionname(parameters):
    """document string"""

     statements

     [return stmt]

      document string says about the functionality of function
      All the stmts within the function should follow the same space indentation


     
calling or executing a function:
    
functionname(parameters)

            """displays a msg"""

         display()
