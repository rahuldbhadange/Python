Ah right yes.  

git is offline first.  

Nothing happens on VSTS until you 'push'.    



The first time you want to upload a new branch you run like: git push --set-upstream azure dev-rahul-14195 


And then you use:  git branch -vva _ _ _ _ _ to see where you local branch is pointing. It will also tell you if you are ahead/behind the remote branch 


Then you can just run:    git push _ _ _ _ _ to push your latest changes.   


If you've changed history you might need to (git push -f) but that will overwrite remote history so you should be careful with that one.




Oh and you can update your repo's knowledge of VSTS by running:  git fetch azure 


Its always safe to fetch


You can always run:   git fetch azure _ _ _ _ _ to download the latest info from VSTS 


Then:    git branch -vva _ _ _ _ _  to show the state of all branches known to your repo 


And then:      git rebase _ _ _ _ _ to update to latest of the remote branch.  (git rebase azure/dev   for example)
