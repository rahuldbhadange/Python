Introduction
============

This is a series of "how to" guides to writing an :term:`integrator` and/or a :term:`follower`.

In the Iotic :term:`Twin <Digital Twin>` model, the twin exists to receive data from an integrator and either to save it,
in the case of :term:`Event` s or to just forward it on to any followers - as in the case of time-series data.

At the moment, all the APIs are in python and are built as python packages. Each integrator, follower and set of
events is also built as a package.

    TODO

    Later it would be useful to find a way to integrate https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/iotic_digitaltwin/tree/dev/dt/python/doc/threads .
