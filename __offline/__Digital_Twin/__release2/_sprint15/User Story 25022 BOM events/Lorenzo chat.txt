Good Morning Lorenzo 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:10 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Hi Rahul. Sorry I was on a meeting and I'm having a new meeting in 10 mins 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:10 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
How are you ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:11 PM]  
I'm doing good, thank you
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:11 PM]  
Have you got any clue about T2 response ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:13 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Actually not, today I'm going to ask someone about it because otherwise I cannot help you with this issue 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:14 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
In any case would yuou mind to push all the code on your branch in VSTS ? So that I can have a look at it 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:14 PM]  
I can do that
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:14 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Maybe the problem is elsewhere 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:15 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Thank you Rahul 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:15 PM]  
Okay, I will do that
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:29 PM]  
Hey Lorenzo
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:29 PM]  
I have push the code, please have a look
 
[?8/?6/?2019 2:49 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Sure, thank you 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:41 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Hi Rahul. I'm looking at your code. Could you please send me all the output you get before getting {"code":"failed requesting BOM"} 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:42 PM]  
I was checking from the first, I'm getting the same error
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:42 PM]  
I have not got any response other than that
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:42 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
So that is your first output ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:42 PM]  
Before and after changes
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:43 PM]  
same response {"code":"failed requesting BOM","description":""} 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:43 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
You don't get any log.info() message ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:43 PM]  
No 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:44 PM]  
The above one only
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:44 PM]  
With respect to this : http://localhost:8080/engine-bom-as-maintained/1000015 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:46 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Could you try to change the integrator.log.yml of the sapbomasbuit so that you can receive info messages ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:46 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
By looking at your code it seems to be set to DEBUG 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:49 PM]  
sure, could you suggest the change ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:49 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
The error seems to be from line 190 to 194 of impl.py 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:50 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
In fact when you do "requests.get(endpoint..." and check for the status of the response, you get that the status code is not found 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:51 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
At line 194 there's the method to make the message {"code":"failed requesting BOM","description":""} appear 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:52 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
impl.py of sapbomasbuilt 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:53 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
To this regard, there is surely an error in either the endpoint as per line 184, or either usr or pwd as per lines 185-186 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:56 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I think I get the error 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:57 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I m going to tell you the errors in VSTS if you agree 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:58 PM]  
Actually Line numbers are not matching with the mine ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:59 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
mmh. Ok Have a look on VSTS 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 3:59 PM]  
Okay,
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:00 PM]  
Can you please share the link ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:00 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes. I'm writing the messages on the commit you pushed yesterday and then I'll share the link 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:01 PM]  
I have push the new code , hour back 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:01 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes, I'm leaving messages in there 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:02 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Would you mind to have a call and I share my screen ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:02 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I think it's easier 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:02 PM]  
Sure
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:03 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Can you do it on Zoom ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:04 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
At the room where we take our standup 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:04 PM]  
Yeah we can do it 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:04 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Cool 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:04 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok join the zoom room 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:25 PM]  
I have changed the sutff ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:25 PM]  
Where we will get the message exactly ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:26 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Are you talking about the logging messages ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:26 PM]  
yeah exactly
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:27 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Within the output, so if you changed the logging from DEBUG to INFO, you will get some extra messages before receiving the error 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:32 PM]  
At cmd or url response ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:32 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
in the shell 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:36 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Otherwise (instead of using logging messages) try with simple print() 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:37 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I think what you should check is the "valid_from" parameter if it is in the right format 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:38 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
For the latter you could add a print message like "print(valid_from)" after the following block:
try:
            valid_from = decoded['Valfr']
        except KeyError:
            log.warning('Valfr not in request')
            self.__integrator_t2_respond_error(request)
            return 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:39 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Also, add a print message for the "response" variable to see if it is correctly constructed 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:39 PM]  
ohh okay
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:40 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
You can do the latter through "print(endpoint)" after "endpoint = self.__sap_config_info.bom_endp_maint.format(asset_id=asset_id, valid_from=valid_from)" 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:42 PM]

[?8/?6/?2019 4:45 PM]  
not working
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:47 PM]  
This is follower response : rqst_data

 {'Valfr': '20190806164716'} 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:48 PM]  
Integrator not receiving the T2 request, this is what I think
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:50 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
So you don't get the messages in the print() for both "on_t2_request" and "__process_t2" ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:51 PM]  
no 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:51 PM]  
i'm not getting
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:51 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
ok 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:52 PM]  
What do you think ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:55 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul I'm currently on a meeting. I've also asked another person who is more expert on t2_request. So hopefully I'll provide the answer in a while 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 4:55 PM]  
Sure
 
[?8/?6/?2019 6:51 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Hi Rahul. I received your message. I'm having a call with someone to solve the issue of the t2 requests 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 6:55 PM]  
Actually Muthu and sean discussed, came to the conclusion that we can build the ROn event first
 
[?8/?6/?2019 6:55 PM]  
that's why I have raised the PR
 
[?8/?6/?2019 6:56 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok, but the problem with the t2 requests is still there, right ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 6:59 PM]  
yes, so they decided to build without T2 request for the sake of UI guys
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:00 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:00 PM]  
And asked to work on T2 request after deployment
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:00 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok, that's fine then 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:00 PM]  
So UI guys will start their work\integration
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:00 PM]  
Tell me one thing
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:02 PM]  
So I have push the code, removing T2 request part from (bom_view\__init__\impl), 

 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:02 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
In any case Fabio will come back tomorrow, so he'll have a look at it too 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:02 PM]  
At what ??
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:03 PM]  
RON events or T2 request ??
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:03 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
At your code and also the Muthu's. I think he'll be a second reviewer 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:03 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
The Pull Requests 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:03 PM]  
I have push the code, removing T2 request part from (bom_view\__init__\impl),  
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:04 PM]  
you are the only reviewer 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:04 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
For now I'm the only reviewer 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:05 PM]  
Yeah, we have raised PR only for you to review
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:05 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I have to hear from him if he wants to review the code, as well 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:05 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
But today I'll have a first review 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:06 PM]  
Who Fabio ???
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:06 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
YES 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:07 PM]  
What about deployment then??

 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:07 PM]  
for both RON as well as service history??
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:07 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:08 PM]  
When you will deploy ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:09 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I don't know yet 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:10 PM]  
Can you please speak to Fabio ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:16 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Fabio is not available today. The only thing I can do is to check the PR and in case merge the code on VSTS 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:17 PM]  
okay
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:18 PM]  
I will wait for the comments then 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:51 PM]  
How can we remove ini files and  deps/ioticlabs.dt.api-0.1.15.tar.gz 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:53 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I'll tell you as soon as I finish the review 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 7:53 PM]  
Okay
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:07 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul I have a question 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:08 PM]  
Yes please
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:08 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
in the fields of SapBomAsIbaseChangeSet events there is 'Sernr' 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:09 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I'm talking about the rrps.dt.event __init__ file 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:10 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
By looking at the user story this field doesn't seem to be included. Is it something that Fabio or someone else told you to include anyway ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:13 PM]  
As I remember Nobody told me specifically about "Sernr" but I don't remober that I have included it.
If you can recall, Fabio has made some changes (at time of follower issue)
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:14 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok thank you. I will leave it for now 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:14 PM]  
wait
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:16 PM]  
I have checked the previous code, I have included it (field('Sernr', 'string', doc='IB: Serial numbers')) but later on fabio updated it as (field('Sernr', 'string', doc='The aggregate serial number.'), )
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:17 PM]  
If he have not deleted it then I guess, it meant to be there. What do you think ? rest up to you .
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:18 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes he probably wants it to be there 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:18 PM]  
yeah I think so
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:19 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Anyway I talked to Mark and he said that Fabio will make a second review and merge the code 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:19 PM]  
ohh
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:19 PM]  
Is your review completed ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:19 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Not yet 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:19 PM]  
okay I will wait
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:22 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
When do you have to leave for today ? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:24 PM]  
It is time actually but I have to finish it, so I will wait
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:27 PM]  
I'm going for dinner, will be back in 20 min
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:27 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Sure 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:37 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok Rahul. You can proceed with the small changes commented on VSTS. 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:39 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
To remove the ini file and other file from the commit, you have to something like:
git reset HEAD path/to/unwanted_file 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:40 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
You have to do it before the commit command with the new changes 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:41 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Once you've made those changes I'll approve the PR, but as I said the code has to be deployed by Fabio, and therefore I think tomorrow 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 8:56 PM]  
okay I'm checking
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:05 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Let me know when you push the code 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:05 PM]  
No Title

This is output of the git reset HEAD path/to/unwanted_file  
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:06 PM]  
Fabio only removed return statement from follower.py
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:06 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul you had to replace "path/to/unwanted_file" with the path of the files you don't need. In that case the ini files and the .tar.gz file 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:06 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:07 PM]  
I'm sorry
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:07 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
It's all right 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:08 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Let me know if you have any other issue 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:10 PM]  
Done
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:10 PM]  
How can we cross check
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:10 PM]  
$ git reset HEAD rrps/python/rrps.dt.integrator.sapbomasbuilt/cfg/rahul-int-1.ini                                                                                
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:12 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes it seems ok. You should also add /rrps/python/rrps.dt.follower.rest_follower/cfg/rahul-fol.ini and /deps/ioticlabs.dt.api-0.1.15.tar.gz after that one 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:13 PM]  
done with both
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:13 PM]  
Can we cross check this ?? How we will be sure that this is removed ?

 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:14 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
you should do "git status" and see which files are included 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:14 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
The files included should be in green colour 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:15 PM]  
yeah I can see files which are included are in green and above are in red as deleted
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:17 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Okay, if you're happy with the files in green you can push the code (the files included should be the only one you've made the latest changes) 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:17 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
If you're unsure or worried about something we can make a call 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:18 PM]  
I think I'm good

Cool, I'll have a look right now 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:20 PM]  
okay
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:20 PM]  
Let me know
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:24 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul the code is Ok now, but I have to ask you to run some git commands because otherwise there are some conflicts with other files 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:24 PM]  
sure
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:24 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
You should run:
git fetch && rebase 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:25 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
sorry. it's 
git fetch && git rebase

together ?? 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:26 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
that command 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:26 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
If you are unable to do it because you are in Windows, then run "git rebase" first and "git rebase" later 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:26 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
"git fetch" first 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:27 PM]  
can not rebase
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:27 PM]  
unstage changes
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:28 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Do you mind if we make a quick call on Zoom and you share your screen? (if you can't don't worry) 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:29 PM]  
yes of course
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:29 PM]  
same id ?
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:29 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes 
 
[?8/?6/?2019 9:29 PM]  
i'm on

Hello Lorenz
 
[?8/?7/?2019 1:46 PM]  
I have push the code for the unit test - dev-rahul-unit_tests 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 1:46 PM]  
Can you please have a look ?
 
[?8/?7/?2019 1:47 PM]  
I have implemented in two different ways, please let me know

[?8/?7/?2019 2:08 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Thank you Rahul. I'll have a look 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:26 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul I found the error in your unit test 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:26 PM]  
ohh
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:26 PM]  
What is it ?
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:27 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
at line 17, if the event has asset_id = 123 (like you wrote), when you call app_client.open(....) at line 104 you have to put the same asset id 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:28 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
instead you wrote 123 for the event and 1234 at line 104 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:28 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Also, at line 104, instead of calling the endpoint "engine-bom-as-maintained", use "ron" 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:29 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
and therefore line 104 will be "IbaseChanges = app_client.open("/ron/123").json" 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:30 PM]  
Thanks I have changed it now
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:31 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
After line 104 you can use "print(IbaseChanges)" so that you can see what the results are 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:31 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
And you can continue your debugging (I can't do it for you) 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:32 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Let me know if at least "print(IbaseChanges)" prints something so that you can continue your debugging 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:35 PM]  
Yes it is printing the results
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:36 PM]  
But tell me which is the correct approach  
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:36 PM]  
First one or second one ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:37 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
About what ? 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:38 PM]  
I have implemented in two different way of handling the IbaseChanges results 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:38 PM]  
Which one is correct?
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:45 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
You mean the first part and the second part of the same file ? 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:46 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Well it depends on the output that you receive. As I said print the results and see which one is the right one. I can't do debugging for you 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:51 PM]  
No issue 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 3:51 PM]  
Thank you for your response
 
[?8/?7/?2019 4:21 PM]  
If the test passed, why it is not printing result ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 4:22 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Because the prints work only when there's some problem 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 4:23 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
If the test passes the prints don't work 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 4:23 PM]  
Okay
 
[?8/?7/?2019 4:23 PM]  
What is the percentage thing on the right side of the test result ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 4:23 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
So if you still want to use the prints, you can check some dictionary on a wrong way 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:10 PM]  
Hello Lorenzo
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:10 PM]  
Test case for IbaseChanges are looking good
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:11 PM]  
I can push the code, can you please verify ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:14 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok push it 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:14 PM]  
Okay
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:15 PM]  
I have push the code
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:15 PM]  
Please have a look at it
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:15 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul just for you to know, now I'm going to have some lunch, and today I'm leaving at 3PM (UK time) 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:15 PM]  
okay
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:16 PM]  
If the code is good then I will raise the PR immediately 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:17 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Yes, it's fine 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 5:17 PM]  
Please let me know once you done with the verification 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:00 PM]  
Hi Lorenzo
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:00 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Hi Rahul 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:00 PM]  
Is it working fine - test ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:00 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I was on lunch. I'll test it righ now 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:01 PM]  
Okay
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:01 PM]  
No issues, please let me know
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:11 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Rahul the unit test is fine 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:11 PM]  
okay
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:11 PM]  
shall I raise a PR ?
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:13 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I think it's better to have this unit test within the other PR 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:13 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
instead of creating a PR just for the unit test 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:13 PM]  
 within the other PR  ?? Means ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:13 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
The one you raised yesterday 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:14 PM]  
How can we do that now ?? I have created new branch.
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:16 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
It's not difficult. 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:16 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Do yuo want me to write the list of command in here, or you prefer a call on Zoom ? 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:17 PM]  
What ever you are comfortable with 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:18 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok, let's try with the list of commands. If you get an error then we'll have a call 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:19 PM]  
Sure
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:19 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
You can go on the branch of your PR: git checkout dev-rahul-bom_events 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:19 PM]  
ok
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:20 PM]  
done
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:20 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Then fetch and rebase through: git fetch && git rebase 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:20 PM]  
k
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:21 PM]  
HBD2KOR@ECGCN1031334D MINGW64 ~/digital.git (dev-rahul-bom_events)
$ git rebase
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Fast-forwarded dev-rahul-bom_events to refs/remotes/origin/dev-rahul-bom_events. 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:21 PM]  
rebase error
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:21 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok, let me see if I can do it myself 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:22 PM]  
Why ?? any issue ??
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:22 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
I have to check and see what is wrong. Maybe I can also fix the conflicts appearing on VSTS 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:23 PM]  
ohhh
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:23 PM]  
okay
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:37 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Ok Rahul. The test is now with the PR, but I couldn't remove the conflict within the follower.py. I'll wait for Fabio about it 
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:37 PM]  
Okay no issues
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:38 PM]  
Can I see that? Can please share the link ?
 
[?8/?7/?2019 6:39 PM]  
No issues. I have seen it.
 
[?8/?8/?2019 1:36 PM]  
Hey Lorenzo
 
[?8/?8/?2019 1:39 PM]  
Have you got a chance to speak to Fabio regarding T2 request ?
 
[?8/?8/?2019 1:47 PM]  
Hey Lorenzo 
 
[?8/?8/?2019 1:56 PM]  Lorenzo Paris:  
Hi Rahul 
 
[?8/?8/?2019 1:58 PM]  
Have you got a chance to speak to Fabio regarding T2 request ?
