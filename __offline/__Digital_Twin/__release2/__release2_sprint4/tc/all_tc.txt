[?3/?15/?2019 4:34 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ah damn, I see no fielddata events either.  I'll check with Fabio 
 
[?3/?15/?2019 4:35 PM]  
yeah
 
[?3/?15/?2019 4:39 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hmm fabio says there are events in the DB for asset 1000015 & 1000021 -- he suggests changing the synthesiser to only print the FieldDataSuccessSet and then just waiting for them to turn up.  They should get published every 15mins.  But there are some in history too. 
 
[?3/?15/?2019 4:44 PM]  
then?
 
[?3/?15/?2019 4:44 PM]  
need to change in config?
 
[?3/?15/?2019 4:47 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
No need to change config, if you're seeing events then you are connected to the twin.  Change the follower code so that it only prints events from the fielddata integrator 
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:04 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi Rahul, I've spoken to Vilnis about how to merge a follower with integrator.  I'll go through the process myself and write some instructions.  Then I'll get VT to review it.  Then you should be able to have it at the start of next week 
Did you see any fielddata events yet?  Fabio is confident they should be coming through 
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:13 PM]  
Hi
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:13 PM]  
Not yet
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:34 PM]  
I'm running code for specific event, but not getting it (waited for 20 min)
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:36 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hmm weird.  Can you push your 15617 branch with all the config I need to run it and I'll give it a try this afternoon while I write the synthesiser instructions 
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:40 PM]  
done
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:43 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Cool thanks.  Have a nice weekend.  I'll do the synthesiser instructions and I'll try out the follower (y) -- will email 
 
[?3/?15/?2019 6:43 PM]  
Thanks Tim
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:15 PM]  
Hi Tim
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:15 PM]  
Are you in meeting?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:15 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Morning, no, which meeting? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:16 PM]  
Planning?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:16 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ah no, I don't normally join them.  Mark & Fabio are probably on the call though 
They might invite me if I'm needed 
How's it going? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:17 PM]  
I will share mail regarding, weather info set
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:17 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:20 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi yes, it looks OK.  WeatherType should be 'string' not 'date' (using the 144_codes.txt I emailed before)  -- Also I think it would be nice to include 'WeatherStation' -> string -> name of the weather station using thing label.  And perhaps 'WeatherProvider' -> string -> metoffice_forecast, metoffice_observation and later it could be 'openweather' or 'airport weather' etc 
Position?  You could use the LocationSetMixin to remember the location when the weather was found?  (This might be hard to match up later) 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:21 PM]  
Thank you
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:21 PM]  
I will work on suggestions.
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:31 PM]  
One quick que,

our output is like this:
Today's Forecast is :  {
    "time": "2019-03-18T09:00:00Z",
    "feels": 3.0,
    "gust": 18.0,
    "humid": 80.0,
    "temp": 6.0,
    "visib": "GO",
    "winddir": "W",
    "windspd": 11.0,
    "uv": 1.0,
    "type": "7",
    "prob": "5" 

Do we suppose to modify anything to get output in proper form?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:33 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes you should replace type -> "number" with the looked up code from 144_codes.txt (if the source is metoffice_* )  -- And you should add fields for WeatherStation -> place name found in thing_label.  And add WeatherProvider -> "mettofice_forecast" 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:33 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Then when the integrator gets this dictionary it has all the fields it needs to publish the event 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:36 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Also you could add some lookup between the visibility code to a real string.  I think "GO" means "Good"  -- You might be able to find the lookup in the api docs https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint/support/api-reference 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:40 PM]  
One thing need to share Tim,

I will be on leave for next week.
So, Muthu and team is saying please plan accordingly so that we can complete before Friday. 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:41 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok no problem.  I think they will be able to continue your work in progress.  Did you see the patch I emailed at the weekend? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:41 PM]  
yes I went through it.
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:42 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok cool.  I realised later that the IntegratorHelper only needs to handle the callback.  You don't need the stop/start/publish_event functions there.  You can make self.__integrator = Integrator directly in the main class. 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:43 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Will you do some handover to Muthu before you go so he can pick up your branch? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:45 PM]  
I can do that. And we can get involve him in this for something so he will be in sync
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:46 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok cool.  If you let me know you push your branch I can give it a quick review, if that'd be helpful? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:47 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
I have an appointment in 2h45m.  I will be offline for atleast 2 hours.  And then I will be travelling to Cambridge to interview a very senior dev. 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:47 PM]  
ok
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:48 PM]  
Oky
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:48 PM]  
Anything is pending from myside?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:50 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Before you hand over I'd like you to add the integrator code to the synthesiser.  And the find_nearest_weather code.  And have the WeatherInfoSet event defined.  So its code complete.  It doesn't have to be working/tested fully since Muthu can finish it off while you're away. 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:54 PM]  
Before you hand over I'd like you to add the integrator code to the synthesiser.  And the find_nearest_weather code.  ==>> As you mailed on weekend.
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:55 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes kind of.  Obviously the classes should be in their own files.  And it needs some tidying up, it should not print anything and it should do logging.  It needs some error handling.  etc 
I wanted to test the approach worked and as soon as it worked I made the patch and stopped :) 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:58 PM]  
 And have the WeatherInfoSet event defined ==>>

As suggested above? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:59 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes as above with weatherstation and weatherprovider fields 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 2:59 PM]  
okay cool.
thanks a lot.
 
[?3/?18/?2019 3:50 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi Rahul.  There is one more thing you can do.  You could run:   git cherry-pick  c660da605d6fb5e302bd6d5beeaed332a984a7fb    -- This will give you a version bump to your events package.  You should be able to see the FD version 2 events containing location. 
(Obv' you will have to stash or commit your code first) 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 3:51 PM]  
okay
 
[?3/?18/?2019 4:25 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi Rahul, at the moment it looks like the dev branch will become the mvp1.1 release.  Unfortunately it has Ben's location change which is part of mvp2.  Fabio & I will have todo some git branching.  Most likely there will be a new weather-dev or mvp2-dev or something.  Don't raise any PRs for weather plz 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 4:26 PM]  
sure
 
[?3/?18/?2019 4:26 PM]  
Is it fine to push?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 4:26 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes you can push to your own branch 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 4:27 PM]  
okayy
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:08 PM]  
I have push the code

[?3/?18/?2019 5:13 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
hmm can you show me more of the output? 
I'm leaving in < 10mins btw 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:13 PM]  
of Git?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:13 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yep 
Oh was that the output of a git cherry-pick?  Perhaps you had not fetched? 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:14 PM]  
That's all it says?
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:14 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes, run fetch first 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:15 PM]  
git fetch --prune  ??
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:15 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes can do 
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:15 PM]  
ok
 
[?3/?18/?2019 5:16 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Then your local git should know about that ref and you can cherry-pick it

okay
Tim Churchard can't receive IMs right now. Status is unavailable or offline. 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:47 PM]  
Good Morning Tim
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:47 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi Rahul, how's it going? 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:47 PM]  
All good
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:48 PM]  
 Hope you seen the last push?
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:48 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ah no, I'm sorry I haven't had time.  I can look now if you want 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:50 PM]  
I'm working on logging and error handling.
Still if you can see, then I will be sure that I'm going in right direction.
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:50 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok 1 min 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:50 PM]  
Okay:)
 
[?3/?19/?2019 2:52 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok the WeatherInfoSet events looks good.  The WeatherStation and WeatherProvider should be string and set by the find_nearest_weather 
When you're ready the IntegratorHelper an NearestWeather classes should be in their own files next to impl.py and imported 
^ I put them in the same file because laziness... but you can't :) 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:02 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Looks like you're going in the right direction. 
Did you talk to Muthu about handover? 
Today I'm in London meeting with the iotic dev team.  We'll try todo some planning etc but I might be able to answer Skype chats for most of the day 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:03 PM]  
Yes, I have given handover to Muthu.
I'm kind of not fully cleared about the things.
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:05 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok what things?  I can't do a call today but I could try to call sometime to explain the things 
Or I can answer here 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:06 PM]  
Not an issue.
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:06 PM]  
We can work it out here itself
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:07 PM]  
What is exactly aim?
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:08 PM]  
What we want from synthesiser exactly?
 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:12 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok so the aim of the synthesiser to put things together.  We have integrators that integrate to a source of data and send events to the twin.  And we have followers that get events from the twin.  Now we have an event from the twin that contains location and we want to find weather info and combine it into the twin. 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:13 PM]  
Great I thought so
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:15 PM]  
event especially "field data event" ?

Now we have an event from the twin that contains location and we want to find weather info and combine it into the twin. 
=>> event having location, from that location we need to find weather inf for nearest 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:16 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes that is version 2 of the fielddata events.  But you cannot see them in your follower currently.  I will make a weather branch and a fix to show them 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:18 PM]  
continue...

__thing and put it into twin ?? Like integrator storing event normally but now on (syntesiser) will have loaction too.
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:19 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes so the synthesiser will follow the events and look for location of the asset. This should happen every 15mins for every asset. The synthesiser should publish a new event to say at this time, in this place, there was weather of X 
You have a position field in your event, that should be the location of the asset 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:21 PM]  
okay
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:23 PM]  
what and how is the connection of rrps.dt.event/__init__ with our event which we saw after running synthesiser
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:24 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
The synthesiser should publish_event the new WeatherInfoSet event.  You have access to it immediately because of the dev install.  For others to access it you should bump the version in events setup.py (and in your setup.py to require the new version) 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:25 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
But be aware if you publish an event in the env_m it will be there forever.  If you change the fields in your event later you will still have the bad/old ones in your history ;) 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:28 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
You would have to ask fabio very nicely to reset your twin history.   (And ofcourse this situation will not happen on the env_dev because the  event will be reviewed and perfect first etc) 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:28 PM]  
So "WeatherInfoSet event." is kind of format in which weather will be published?

 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:29 PM]  
You would have to ask fabio very nicely to reset your twin history.   (And ofcourse this situation will not happen on the env_dev because the  event will be reviewed and perfect first etc)  

==>> okay
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:29 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Yes WeatherInfoSet is the format in which weather will be associated with the asset in the twin.  The synthesiser will put it together 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:30 PM]  
okay
Today's Forecast is :  {
    "time": "2019-03-14T15:00:00Z",
    "feels": 7.0,
    "gust": 40.0,
    "humid": 56.0,
    "temp": 11.0,
    "visib": "VG",
    "winddir": "WNW",
    "windspd": 22.0,
    "uv": 1.0,
    "type": "3",
    "prob": "1" 


 But these are all in numbers, this is suppose to be like this only?
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:32 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
To that dictionary you should add the weather station name and the weather station type.  And the synthesiser knows the location so that can go in the event position field. 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:34 PM]  
and will automatically fetch that (144_codes.txt) stuff ?
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:35 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ah yes in that dict the type should be string from the 144_codes 
I think the visib has a similar lookup "VG" = "Very Good" ? 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:35 PM]  
I have made the changes:

1: {
    {
        'type': 'record',
        'name': 'WeatherInfoSet',
        'fields': [
            field("WeatherType", "string"),
            field("Position", "string"),
            field("WindSpeed", "float"),
            field("WindDirection", "float"),
            field("WindGust", "float"),
            field("Humidity", "float"),
            field("Visibility", "string"),
            field("Temperature", "float"),
            field("FeelsLikeTemperature", "float"),
            field("MaxUVIndex", "float"),
            field("PrecipitationProbability", "string"),
            field("WeatherStation", "string"),
            field("WeatherProvider", "string"),
            cls._location_field,  # from LocationSetMixin 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:35 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok good 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:36 PM]  
position and location good?
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:36 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
I don't know about the location mixin.  But I think its OK to follow this approach (and Vilnis might fix it later when he fixes Ben's code) 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:36 PM]  
okay
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:36 PM]  
Thank you so much for this one Tim.
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:37 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
No probs.  To make the search for weather slightly more reliable you could add one more argument.   unit=CELSIUS   (Which can be import like this:  from IoticAgent.Units import CELSIUS 
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:40 PM]  
Sure
 
[?3/?19/?2019 3:41 PM]  
Thanks. will get back to you.
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:24 PM]  
Hi Tim
Good morning
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:24 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi, morning, how's it going? 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:25 PM]  
I have push the my thing, please have a look and suggest above task
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:25 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:25 PM]  
thanks
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:33 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
OK it's looking good.  I'm just writing some points to work on 2 mins 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:36 PM]  
Okay
 
[?3/?20/?2019 2:40 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
1. Move the IntegratorHelper class back to impl.py and name it like IntegratorCB
2. Instantiate the new IntegratorCB class in the synthesiser init so the callbacks get handled
3. on_FieldData should be lowercase
4. on_fielddata move the ack_event to the top under the log.info (make it a log.debug too)
5. on_fielddata remove the if event_version and just do find_nearest everytime with hardcoded location
6. Write/Test the publish_event code
NearestWeather
7. Tidy up exception handling (don't catch bare except: ) 
8. find_nearest_weather -- Consider adding a time param (datetime object)?  Then you could loop over the recent samples to find the nearest time?  And perhaps have some threshold where weather is not close enough in time (4 hours?)
9. If not adding time parameter then make it get_recent(1) instead of get_recent(99)
10. callback_recent (perhaps rename to process_data or something)
11. Remove pretty_print when debugging is finished. 
I pasted to Muthu by mistake :) 
Anyway I think it is quite good

[?3/?20/?2019 3:49 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hmm, weird.  Wasn't it running before? 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:50 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Anyway the problem is normally in __main__.py where it loads the config.  You see it has loaded the contents of the agent.ini and passed it as the filename 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:51 PM]  
I have not tried. Means after your cfg changes (integrator to synthesiser), not getting output no. So not tested
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:51 PM]  
yes
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:51 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok can you push to your branch and I'll try to run it? 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:52 PM]  
okay
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:53 PM]  
I have created instance under init,   self.__IntegratorCB = IntegratorCB 

Anything need to change for callbacks (on_asset_created(self, asset_id): (integrator))
 
[?3/?20/?2019 3:57 PM]  
push done
 
[?3/?20/?2019 4:32 PM]  
Hi Tim
 
[?3/?20/?2019 4:33 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Hi sorry something came up, I'll check it in a minute 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 4:33 PM]  
sure
 
[?3/?20/?2019 4:48 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
OK I've pushed a fix to your branch 
The synthesiser cfg needs both follower and integraotr section so I've added that.  The main had a minor mistake.  And the IntegratorCB was not registered. 
I've tested it starts but have not tested it beyond that 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 4:50 PM]  
okay
 
[?3/?20/?2019 5:00 PM]  
config issue resolve but there are multiple errors in init and main.

Are we expecting field data output?
 
[?3/?20/?2019 5:02 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
There are old style fielddata events in history.  You can use on_fielddatasuccess to catch those incoming.  You won't get fielddata location at the moment. 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 5:13 PM]  
After this what is the next thing?
 
[?3/?20/?2019 7:08 PM]  
I think int...cb are running but failing at follower
 
[?3/?20/?2019 7:08 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
Ok, example/explain? 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 7:08 PM]  
can I show you output error?

Hi Tim
 
[?3/?20/?2019 7:51 PM]  
We suppose to run synthesier/impl only no?
 
[?3/?20/?2019 7:51 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
It's supposed to run with command like:  rrps-dt-synthesiser-weather -l cfg/synthesiser.cfg.yml cfg/synthesiser.cfg.yml cfg/agent_foll.ini 
 
[?3/?20/?2019 7:52 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
You can add whatever python files you need.   We chose __main__ -> impl but ofcourse some integrators/followers/synthesisers will have more code.  Like this one needs nearestweather 
For deployment we use docker and the entrypoint will be rrps-dt-synthesiser-weather command

[?3/?20/?2019 7:56 PM]  Tim Churchard:  
I think you can fetch and rebase.  You might want to edit/squash the commits to hide that I've changed your branch. 
I think you need to edit the cfg/synth... to put the stuff for env_m in there.  You should be able to copy/diff from sapmasterdata integrator.cfg.yml
