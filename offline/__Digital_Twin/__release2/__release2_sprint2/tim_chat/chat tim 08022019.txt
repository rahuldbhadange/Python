1 sec I'll check 
I think the equnr_endpoint & sernr_endpoint do not need user/pass.  They are like a public lookup function (but internal to RR)

Ah interesting 
Ok, put a comment on the PR after you have pushed the branch so we remember to check it 
*Or a comment in the code/config

Oh and remember 6 hours from now I will be on holiday.  Lorenzo & Fabio are the best contacts while I'm away.  They have a list of tasks to give you 
Then I'm back 25th Feb 
 

:) Yep hopefully the tasks will be interesting.  They will be more challenging than the current ones.  Fabio has a plan for unit testing + mocking of some classes.   And also there are some new RR APIs that need integrators (and extensions to existing integrators).
