OK I've spoken to Fabio about 14374.  

He pointed out that we need to handle 404 specially.  

Apart from that the code is good. 

Could you make the minor change above raise_for_status everywhere? 








 And have the WeatherInfoSet event defined ==>>

As suggested above?









def main():
    signal(SIGTERM, sigterm_handler)

    args = parse_args()
    follower = follower_via_storeutil(args) if args.storeutil else follower_via_args(args)
    try:
        follower.run()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
